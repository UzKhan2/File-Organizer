# Folder Organizer

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts designed to streamline folder organization on my computer. The primary focus is on the "File Renamer" script, the cornerstone of this project, providing essential functionality for efficient folder management. The other files include a wider assortment of versatile but specific use-case tools designed to help me keep my directories tidy and clutter-free.

### File Renamer

After selecting a base folder, the File Renamer script systematically renames all picture and video files within that folder to match the name of the base folder. Notably, this process accommodates files with names exceeding the 260-character path length limit on Windows.

### Mass Folder Mover

The "Mass Folder Mover" script simplifies the task of consolidating files. Upon selecting a base folder, the program moves all files within any subfolders out and into the main folder.

### FileRenameRandomizer

The "FileRenameRandomizer" script offers a quick solution for renaming a selected file to a random string of characters. This method is incorporated into the File Renamer script for handling files with excessively long names.

### FolderRenameRandomizer

An extension of the FileRenameRandomizer code, the "FolderRenameRandomizer" script facilitates mass renaming of all files in a folder, assigning each a random string of characters.
